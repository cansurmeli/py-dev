# README

The development environment I use when developing a Python project.

It is Dockerised so that environment freezing in enabled by default and everything is isolated on a per project basis that specific dependencies are a breeze to define and nothing contradicts with another project.

## Why Docker?

There are other options out there to enable environment freezing; such as Conda. However, I already use Docker a lot and like it pretty much. Hence, Docker.

## What's Inside?

I actually tried to keep it pretty simple. Besides a few installs, I grab Vim from the source. Thereafter, I add my own dotfiles for the CLI environment I am used to.
